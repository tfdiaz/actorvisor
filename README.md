# Actorvisor
## Become your inner actor with AI
*AngelHack Silicon Valley 2019 1st place for AWS category created by Tomas Diaz and Juhno Lee*

**About**

This project was the result of a 24 hour challenge for AngelHack. Our goal was to use AWS machine learning services to the best of our ability. Having no previous experience with AWS we had to come up with something that we could actually implement in the short time we were allocated. Actorvisor is the result. We are currently investigating a full build out of the application.
